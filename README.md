Hello World!
I'm here to join the 21st century and learn coding
in modern languages, starting with C#.
The last time that I coded anything, it was
written in dBASE 3! I want to learn OOP, though, and
perhaps make a little money from home writing code
snippets? I welcome advise from everyone on the subject of
producing freelance for money.
